            <h3> About Me</h3>
            <p>Originally from Lansing, Michigan, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Hospitality Business
                from Michigan State University. After completing my internship requirements for my degree in Aspen, CO, I stayed there for a few years working at a luxury resort where I met my Argentinian husband.
                We then decided to move to San Diego, CA where we still reside today. I have remained involved in the hospitality industry, as my husband and I own a catering company called Asado Gaucho: an Argentinian Meat Dining Experience.
                As our business is growing, I have had the opportunity to grow my own career and knowledge and dive into the world of coding. 
                Although I am still a newbie at coding, I am very excited to showcase my work and continue to expand my knowledge and experience.
